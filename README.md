__1. Probability and Statistics:__ basics of probability & statistics, visualization <br />
<br />
__2. Introduction to Statistical Learning and Regression Analysis:__ statistical Learning (Supervised & Unsupervised, Estimation), simple & multiple linear regression <br />
<br />
**3. Introduction to Classification:** general framework, hard vs soft classifiers, logistic regression, discriminant analysis, naive bayes<br />
<br />
**4. Model Evaluation and Resampling:** regression & classification models, cross-validation and resampling <br />
<br />
**5. Model Selection, Regularization, and Dimensionality Reduction:** pros & cons & possible improvements at linear models, variable selection, shrinkage mothods, dimension reduction vs variable selection, Principal component analysis <br />
<br />
**6. Beyond Linearity:** polynomial regression, step functions, regression with basis functions, regression splines, generalized additive models <br />
<br />
**7. Decision Trees:** regression trees (construction recipe and loss function), classification tree (choice of the cost function) <br />
<br />
**8. Tree-Based Methods:** ensemble mothods for trees (bagging, random forests, boosting) <br />
<br />
**9. Support Vector Machines:** linear classifiers, linear separability, support vector machines (maximum margin principle, soft margin, more extreme cases, kernel method) <br />
<br />
