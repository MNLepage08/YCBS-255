## Statistical Machine Learning

1. Probability and Statistics:
   - Basics of probability & statistics, visualization
2. Introduction to Statistical Learning and Regression Analysis:
   - Statistical Learning (Supervised & Unsupervised, Estimation), simple & multiple linear regression 
3. Introduction to Classification: 
   - General framework, hard vs soft classifiers, logistic regression, discriminant analysis, naive bayes
4. Model Evaluation and Resampling:
   - Regression & classification models, cross-validation and resampling
5. Model Selection, Regularization, and Dimensionality Reduction:
   - Pros & cons & possible improvements at linear models, variable selection, shrinkage mothods, dimension reduction vs variable selection, Principal component analysis
6. Beyond Linearity:
   - Polynomial regression, step functions, regression with basis functions, regression splines, generalized additive models <br />
7. Decision Trees:
   - Regression trees (construction recipe and loss function), classification tree (choice of the cost function) 
8. Tree-Based Methods:
   - Ensemble mothods for trees (bagging, random forests, boosting) <br />
9. Support Vector Machines:
   - Linear classifiers, linear separability, support vector machines (maximum margin principle, soft margin, more extreme cases, kernel method) <br />
10. Introduction to Unsupervised Learning:
    - Cluster analysis (k-means & hierarchical clustering) <br />
